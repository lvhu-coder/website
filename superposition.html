        <h1>Superposition: The Core of Quantum Computation</h1>
        
        <p>
            Superposition is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that allows a quantum system to exist in multiple states simultaneously. 
            Unlike classical bits, which are either 0 or 1, a qubit in superposition can represent a combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩, 
            enabling parallel computation over many possibilities.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Mathematical Representation</h2>
        <p>
            The state of a qubit in superposition is written as:
            <br>
            <code>|ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩</code>
            <br>
            where α and β are complex probability amplitudes such that |α|² + |β|² = 1. The qubit’s actual state upon measurement collapses probabilistically.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Multi-Qubit Systems</h2>
        <p>
            In a system of n qubits, superposition allows the system to simultaneously represent 2ⁿ possible states. This exponential growth in representable states 
            is one reason quantum computers can solve certain problems much faster than classical computers.ce.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Applications in Computation</h2>
        <p>
            Superposition is leveraged in quantum algorithms like Grover’s search, quantum simulations, and Shor’s factoring algorithm. 
            It enables computations that would require astronomical time on classical systems.
