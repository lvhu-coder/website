    <h1>Qubits: The Quantum Unit of Information</h1>
    
    <p>
        In quantum computing, a qubit is the fundamental unit of information. Unlike classical bits, qubits exploit quantum phenomena 
        to represent information in multiple states simultaneously. Implementations include superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Physical Implementations</h2>
    <p>
        Superconducting qubits use Josephson junctions to create energy states, while trapped ions leverage electromagnetic fields 
            to confine and manipulate ionized atoms. Photonic qubits encode information in polarization or path modes of photons.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Qubit Properties</h2>
    <h3>Superposition</h3>
    <p>
        Qubits can exist in a linear combination of |0⟩ and |1⟩, enabling parallel computation over an exponentially large state space.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Entanglement</h3>
    <p>
        Multiple qubits can become entangled, creating correlations that are impossible in classical systems. Entanglement is crucial 
        for quantum teleportation, cryptography, and algorithms.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Coherence and Decoherence</h3>
    <p>
        Maintaining qubit coherence is essential for reliable computation. Decoherence, caused by interaction with the environment, 
        introduces errors, which quantum error correction seeks to mitigate.
