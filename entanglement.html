        <h1>Entanglement: Correlations Beyond Classical Limits</h1>
        
        <p>
            Quantum entanglement is a non-classical correlation between qubits where the state of one qubit instantly affects the state of another, 
            regardless of distance. Einstein famously referred to it as “spooky action at a distance.”
        </p>
        
        <h2>Bell States</h2>
        <p>
            Entangled qubits are often represented using Bell states, such as:
            <br>
            <code>|Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2</code>
            <br>
            The measurement of one qubit immediately determines the outcome of its partner, illustrating the strong correlations that are impossible in classical physics.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>
            Entanglement is crucial for quantum teleportation, superdense coding, error correction codes, and enabling quantum algorithms to achieve speedups. 
            Without entanglement, many advantages of quantum computing would not be possible.
